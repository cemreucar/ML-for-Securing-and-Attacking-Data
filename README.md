# ML-for-Securing-and-Attacking-Data
Introduction:
Password cracking is a systematic attempt to unveil the password of a secure system, employing various techniques such as common passwords, altered candidate passwords, and brute force methods. To enhance password security, techniques like steganography are employed, where messages are concealed in images by modifying the least significant bits (LSB) of pixels, making the hidden message imperceptible to the human eye.

LSB Steganography Methods:
In LSB steganography, two primary methods are prevalent. The naive LSB replacement involves altering the LSB bit if the message bit differs, causing an imbalance in the image histogram detectable by statistical methods. The second method, LSB matching, addresses this by randomly adjusting pixel values, ensuring a more inconspicuous alteration and complicating steganalysis using statistical methods alone.

Classical Cryptography and PUFs:
Classical cryptography relies on secret keys stored in electronic devices, posing challenges in cost and confidentiality. Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) provide an alternative by generating outputs that are swiftly evaluated and challenging to predict. PUF-based authentication involves challenging an unknown device with binary strings, checking responses for identification probability. PUFs are not infallible, yielding different responses under varying conditions.

Machine Learning for PUF Attacks:
In response to the dynamic field of PUFs, Machine Learning is employed to attack specific PUFs, with ongoing developments introducing more secure PUFs and methodologies for enhanced reliability and security.

HIPAA Data Breaches Exploration:
Data exploration is foundational in data analysis, utilizing visual methods to understand dataset characteristics. In a project involving breaches of HIPAA confidential information, data visualization is employed to provide an optical context for identifying patterns and correlations in the dataset.

Conclusion:
Data breaches, characterized by data leakage, necessitate robust security measures. Techniques like steganography, classical cryptography, and PUFs, combined with advancements in Machine Learning, play pivotal roles in securing and understanding data vulnerabilities. The HIPAA breaches project showcases the significance of data exploration and visualization in comprehending and addressing confidential information breaches.
